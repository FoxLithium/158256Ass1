## Task List

Based on "Assignment 1 Group Work - Part 1 - Web Site Evaluation_158256TSNI.pdf", "Web Design Best Practices Checklist.pdf".

Coorcinator: Li Zheng

Public Secretary: \[Need to be updated\]

Please be advised you are free to use images like screenshot and charts as you wish. In the following table, bolted text means you can find some help in "Web Design Best Practices Checklist.pdf". After finishing a task(4 - 11), please write suggestions of improving this site and a summary of judgement about this attribute in an **additional** file. A summary about the attribute is *necessary*, for it will lessen public secretary's burden. You will find an example later.
